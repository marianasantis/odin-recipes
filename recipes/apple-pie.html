        <li>In a bowl, combine and mix the sugars, flour & spices. Then set aside. Get another bowl for the apples. Toss them with lemon juice. After that, add the sugar mixture. Do more tossing to coat the apples.</li>

        <li>Beat egg white until foamy and brush over pastry. Sprinkle with sugar. Cover the edges loosely with foil.  </li>
