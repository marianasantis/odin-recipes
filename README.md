# Odin Recipes

This is my first project. After learning a bit of HTML and CSS I created this webpage called Odin Recipes. This page shows 3 different recipes and you can click it to go to it's webpage.

I tried to use all I've learned until now. Basic GIT, HTML and CSS.
The main page was designed to look good on my computer with my monitor resolution (1024x786) so I made all the math (margins, etc) using this resolution as a reference. I didn't learn how to create responsive CSS yet, so I'll focus on the basics for now.
